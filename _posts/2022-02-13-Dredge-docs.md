Check out [the new docs section](/docs/quick-start-guide/). It's short and sweet: a [quick start guide](/docs/quick-start-guide/) on how to install Dredge and some documentation about the [Dredgefile format](http://localhost:4000/docs/dredgefile/).

I've also released [version 0.0.2 of Dredge](https://github.com/dredge-dev/dredge/releases/tag/v0.0.2). It introduces buckets to group workflows and includes a `browser` step that can open a URL in a browser.
