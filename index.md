# How it works

## 01. Workflows

Developer workflows are abstracted into standardised commands. The doc-search workflow searches the project docs, wherever they are hosted. The build workflow invokes your build tools to build the project. You get the picture!

## 02. Sharing

Don't reinvent the wheel, share and import common workflows. For example import workflows for a project using SpringBoot, Gradle, GitHub, Snyk, Jira & Slack.

## 03. Profit

Run the development workflows from your IDE. No need to remember the particular quirks for each project, these are now abstracted away into the workflows.
